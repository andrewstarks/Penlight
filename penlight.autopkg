The map and reduce functions now take the function first, as Nature intended.

The Python-like overloading of '*' for strings has been dropped, since it is silly. Also, strings are no longer callable; use 's:at(1)' instead of 's(1)' - this tended to cause Obscure Error messages.

Wherever a function argument is expected, you can use the operator strings like '+','==',etc as well as pl.operator.add, pl.operator.eq, etc. (see end of pl/operator.lua for the full list.)

tablex now has compare() and compare_no_order(). An explicit set() function has been added which constructs a table with the specified keys, all set to a value of true.

List has reduce() and partition() (This is a cool function which separates out elements of a list depending on a classifier function.)

There is a new array module which generalizes tablex operations like map and reduce for two-dimensional arrays.

The famous iterator over permutations from PiL 9.3 has been included.

David Manura's list comprehension library has been included.

Also, utils now contains his memoize function, plus a useful function args which captures the case where varargs contains nils.

There was a bug with dir.copyfile() where the flag was the wrong way round.

config.lines() had a problem with continued lines.

Some operators were missing in pl.operator; have renamed them to be consistent with the Lua metamethod names.

AAS: Added more robust string escaping (works well with long strings)."};
